# IRD-pricer
 An interest rate derivative pricing platform

In this project, we are aiming to deveop a platform for options on interest rates using both BDT and Vasicek models. We start from getting historical data of weekly Treasury yield of past 10 years; interpolation and bootstrapping in order to get spot rate curve ready for further analysis. We choose to value swaptions by analytic and simulation methods of Vasicek model as well as BDT model with monthly steps. Lastly, we compare the different pricing results and provide recommendations.
